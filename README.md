## 🛠️ The Journey: Project Steps Unveiled! 🗺️

Our project unfolded through a structured series of steps to ensure data integrity and impactful visualization:

1.  **🧼 Data Cleaning using SQL**: We started by meticulously cleaning and refining the raw data using robust SQL queries. [cite_start]Think of it as polishing raw diamonds! 
2.  📤 Data Export with Power BI**: Once sparkling, the cleaned data was seamlessly exported to Power BI, our canvas for dynamic visualizations. 
3.  **🧠 Data Processing & DAX**: This phase involved sophisticated data processing and crafting essential measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). This is where the magic of insights begins! 
4.  **🎨 Dashboard Creation**: The heart of our project! We designed and developed intuitive and interactive dashboards for both credit card transactions and customer reports. Visual storytelling at its best! 
5.  **🌟 Insight Generation**: The grand finale! We extracted compelling and actionable insights from our dashboards to empower data-driven decision-making. Knowledge is power!

## 📥 Importing Data to SQL Database: A Behind-the-Scenes Look! ⚙️

The foundation of our analysis lay in the efficient import of data into our SQL database. Here's how we did it:

1.  [cite_start]**📄 Prepare CSV File**: Our data journey began with preparing the raw CSV files. [cite: 125]
2.  [cite_start]**➕ Create Tables in SQL**: Next, we sculpted the necessary tables within our SQL database to house the incoming data. [cite: 126]
3.  [cite_start]**⬆️ Import CSV File into SQL**: Finally, the cleaned CSV data was imported directly into SQL. [cite: 127]
    * **Success Story**: For instance, a query successfully copied 10108 rows in just 82 milliseconds! That's speed! [cite_start]⚡ [cite: 129, 130]

## 💡 Decoding Data: Our DAX Query Arsenal! 🏹

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was our secret weapon for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Here are some key DAX formulas we employed:

### 👶👵 AgeGroup Calculation: Categorizing Our Valued Customers!
This DAX formula intelligently groups customers into distinct age brackets based on their `customer_age`:
```dax
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",  // Young Explorers! 🧑‍🎤
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40", // Rising Stars! 🌟
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50", // Established Achievers! 🏆
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60", // Experienced Pros! 🦉
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+", // Wise & Wonderful! 👵👴
    "unknown" // The Mysterious Ones! 👻
)
